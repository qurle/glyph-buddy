Glyph Matrix Example Project
====================

About the Demo
--------------
This example project contains multiple toy demos:
- `basic` demo which shows the application icon
    - `Touch-down` (press down) to increment and display a counter
    - `Touch-up` (release) to stop incrementing the counter
- `glyphbutton` demo which shows a randomly populated grid
    - `Long-press` the `Glyph Button` on the device to generate a new random grid
- `animation` demo which shows an indefinite animation until the toy is deactivated

After going through the `Setup` stage in this document the demo project can be run on the device.
> Tip: `Short-press` the `Glyph Button` to navigate between the toys.

The demo project already contains the necessary libraries (GlyphMatrix SDK) and source structure as an example. However, if you want to install libraries for your own application, please reference the [**SDK documentation**](https://github.com/KenFeng04/GlyphMatrix-Development-Kit).

This demo is written in Kotlin, it also utilize  a useful Kotlin wrapper `GlyphMatrixService.kt`ï¼Œwrap around the original SDK that you can use in your own project.
